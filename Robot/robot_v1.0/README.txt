|robot version 1.0   |
|********************|

Function: 1¡¢the robot can read some of the basic sentences
		  and give out a right respond. For example, I
		  ask it "what are you doing?", it will respond
		  with "I'm working.", and I say "i gonna go.",
		  it will answer "see you, sir!". The key is that
		  the robot can understand your sentences even
		  you spell in a wrong way but similar to the
		  original one.
		  2¡¢Another important idea is that the robot can
		  raise up a topic at any time it prefer, there 
		  are so many interesting topics it knows that it
		  seems like a real speaker.
		  3¡¢the last function is decided for myself. Because
		  i am bad at controlling myself to study hard, i say
		  "make agenda", it will help me to build up a plan for
		  tomorrow. Next day 11 o'clock at night it will inform
		  me to check the homework automatically.

A letter for all readers:
	There are still many problem that needed to be solved, such as how
to learn from user while talking and how to build up the emotion for
itself. It is such a long way to go, but i am not quiting untill dead.
Thanks for all crazy AI-Lover reading my program and if you have any
good idea to make the robot more advanced, please contact me with e-mail
